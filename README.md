[Verse]
Tick tock goes the clock
Old and new will never stop
Ragtime beats in the street
Modern love at my feet

[Verse]
Tick tock, ink on skin
Old designs and new begin
Needle hums, art complete
Tattoo stories can't delete






[Verse 2]
Feel the bass city pace
Electronic ragtime race
Dancing now in the past
Fusion here make it last

[Verse 2]
Feel the buzz, steady hand
Creating art, we understand
Colors blend, lines align
Permanent through space and time



[Chorus]
Ragtime techno beat
Hear the future meet
Step through history's door
Dance forever more

[Chorus]
Ink and needle's beat
Life in art we meet
Step into the parlor's door
Tattooed forever more





[Bridge]
Piano notes cut the night
Techno rhythm pure delight
Every heartbeat syncs with mine
Timeless love we find

[Bridge]
Needle's hum cuts the night
Tattoo rhythm pure delight
Every heartbeat, every line
Timeless art we find



[Verse 3]
Echoes of a bygone tune
Underneath the techno moon
Fusion dreams keep us high
Bringing joy to the sky

[Verse 3]
Echoes of an ancient style
Modern tattoos make us smile
Fusion dreams on the skin
Bringing stories from within


[Chorus]
Ragtime techno beat
Hear the future meet
Step through history's door
Dance forever more


[Chorus]
Ink and needle's beat
Life in art we meet
Step into the parlor's door
Tattooed forever more
